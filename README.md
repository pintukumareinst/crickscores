# crickscores

Cricket is a wonderful and very popular game all across the world. It is said that cricket is being played since Colonial period. Every year many international tournaments and matches are organized throughout the world.


Many of the cricket lovers will watch cricket on televisions and some people will go to stadiums to watch the match’s. But now-a-days with the busy work pressure people don’t have time to watch cricket by going to the stadiums and even watch on the televisions and some category of the people don’t  want to watch all the match they will only watch score, wickets fall, and who are playing on the field.

To overcome this issue I created a ASP.NET Web Application (.NET Framework) using C# programming language called “Crick Scores” where anyone can visit and enjoy live scores, results, calendar upcoming matches etc and much more.

Area of specialization of topic : Web Development

It is a web application using popular front end frameworks like html5, bootstrap and back end sever side using asp.net.
 
Front end – HTML5, Bootstrap, Font Awesome

HTML5 : HTML5 is  markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. It is the fifth and last major HTML version that is a World Wide Web Consortium recommendation. The current specification is known as the HTML Living Standard. It is maintained by a consortium of the major browser vendors (Apple, Google, Mozilla, Microsoft) the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group and Microsoft), the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG). 

Bootstrap : Bootstrap is a free, open-source HTML, CSS, and JS framework containing templates for text, forms, buttons, navigation, and other relevant interface components. Being a front-end framework, Bootstrap is an interface for the user, unlike server-side code that resides on the back-end server.

Font Awesome : Font Awesome is a Font and icon toolkit based on CSS and less. It was made by Dave Gandy for use with Bootstrap, and later was incorporated into the Bootstrap CND. Font Awesome has a 38% market share among those websites that use third-party font scripts on their platform, ranking it second place after Google fonts.

Server side - asp.net : ASP.NET is an open-source, server-side web-application framework designed for web development to produce dynamic web pages. It was developed by Microsoft to allow programmers to build dynamic web sites, applications and services.

API - cricapi.com : I have use an API from “cricapi.com” to fetch the data for the list of international matches, live scores, lists of results, lists of upcoming matches that is calendar.
